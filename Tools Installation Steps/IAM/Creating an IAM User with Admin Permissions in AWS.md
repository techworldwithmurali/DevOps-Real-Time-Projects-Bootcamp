### Creating an IAM User with Admin Permissions in AWS
To create an IAM user named "moole" with administrative permissions, generate access keys, and provide console access with a password, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Use your root or IAM user credentials to sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. **Open the IAM Console**:
   - Navigate to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console by searching for "IAM" in the services menu.

3. **Create a New User**:
   - Click on **Users** in the left sidebar.
   - Click on the **Add user** button.
   - In the **User name** field, enter `moole`.
   - Under **Access type**, check both **Programmatic access** (to generate access keys) and **AWS Management Console access** (to provide console access).

4. **Set Console Password**:
   - In the **Console password** section, select **Custom password** and enter `DevOps@2580`. Ensure that you select the option for the user to change their password at the next sign-in if desired.

5. **Set Permissions**:
   - Click **Next: Permissions**.
   - On the permissions page, choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
   - In the search bar, type `AdministratorAccess`.
   - Check the box next to **AdministratorAccess** to grant full access to AWS services.
   - Click **Next: Tags**.

6. **Add Tags (Optional)**:
   - You can optionally add tags to the user for organizational purposes.
   - Click **Next: Review** when done.

7. **Review and Create User**:
   - Review the settings to ensure everything is correct.
   - Click the **Create user** button.

8. **Download Credentials**:
   - Once the user is created, you will see a success message along with the userâ€™s access keys. Make sure to download the `.csv` file or copy the access key ID and secret access key as they will not be shown again.

After completing these steps, the IAM user "moole" will have administrative permissions, programmatic access (access keys), and console access with the specified password.
