### Installation of Docker on Windows

### Step 1: Check System Requirements
Ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later) or Windows 11.
- Hardware virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS.

### Step 2: Download Docker Desktop
- Go to the official Docker website: [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Click on the **Download for Windows** button to download the Docker Desktop installer.

### Step 3: Run the Installer
- Locate the downloaded installer file (usually named `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`) in your Downloads folder and double-click it to run.

### Step 4: Accept the License Agreement
- In the installation wizard, read and accept the license agreement by checking the box and clicking **OK**.

### Step 5: Enable WSL 2 (if prompted)
- Docker Desktop uses WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) as its default backend. If prompted, follow the instructions to enable WSL 2. This may involve downloading additional components.

### Step 6: Complete Installation
- Click on **Install** to begin the installation process. This may take a few minutes.
- Once the installation is complete, click **Close**.

### Step 7: Start Docker Desktop
- After installation, Docker Desktop should start automatically. If it doesnâ€™t, you can find it in your Start Menu or as a desktop shortcut.
- Upon starting, Docker may prompt you to log in or create a Docker Hub account. You can skip this step if you prefer.

### Step 8: Configure Docker Settings (Optional)
- You can adjust various settings by right-clicking the Docker icon in the system tray and selecting **Settings**.
- Here, you can manage resources (CPU, memory), enable experimental features, and configure other preferences.

### Step 9: Verify the Installation
- Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
- Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed correctly:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
- You should see the installed version of Docker displayed.

### Step 10: Test Docker Installation
- To test Docker, run the following command to download and run a test container:
  ```bash
  docker run hello-world
  ```
- If Docker is working correctly, you will see a message that confirms the installation and shows the Docker container running successfully.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on Windows. You can now start using Docker to build and manage your containerized applications.
